        Yesterday, I started a HTML and CSS course again. Although I have some
        knowledge about creating websites, it is very limited. I am familiar
        with most of the syntax, but I have always wanted to learn how to create
        professional websites. I have experience in AWS services, Javascript and
        Node.JS, so it would be quite sad if I did not know the basics, or even
        more, about creating nice websites. I will document my journey every day
        and have a detailed record of creating my own portfolio website.

        . I wanted to create it from A to Z. Here are some results made on
