        Yesterday, I started a HTML and CSS course again. Although I have some
        knowledge about creating websites, it is very limited. I am familiar
        with most of the syntax, but I have always wanted to learn how to create
        professional websites. I have experience in AWS services, Javascript and
        Node.JS, so it would be quite sad if I did not know the basics, or even
        more, about creating nice websites. I will document my journey every day
        and have a detailed record of creating my own portfolio website.

        . I wanted to create it from A to Z. Here are some results made on
        thursday:

        As a part of a YouTube tutorial, I will be creating a website that
        replicates the look and feel of the YouTube platform. This project will
        serve as a comprehensive documentation of my entire process, from start
        to finish. The goal of this project is to gain practical experience with
        HTML and CSS, as well as to learn about the design principles and user
        interface techniques used by YouTube. By creating a clone of the
        platform, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how websites are
        structured and how design choices can influence user experience.
        Throughout this project, I will be breaking down each step of the
        process, including creating the page layout, styling the page elements,
        and implementing interactive features. By documenting my progress, I
        will not only have a record of my work, but I will also be able to
        reflect on my learning journey and share my experience with others. In
        addition to gaining technical skills, I also hope to develop my
        problem-solving abilities and increase my attention to detail. By
        tackling a complex project like this, I will encounter challenges and
        obstacles that will require me to think creatively and come up with
        solutions. Overall, this project will be a valuable learning experience
        for me, as well as an opportunity to showcase my skills and knowledge to
        others.
