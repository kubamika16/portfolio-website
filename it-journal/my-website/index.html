        16/04/2023 (Sunday) - First day of creating portfolio website - Folder
        Structure & website variables
      </h2>
      <p>
        Today I finally start creating my own personal website. That will be my
        long-term project. Website that will showcase my skills, experience,
        projects and overall commitment for programming and improving my life
        overall.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will start off by making sure that the folder structure is adjusted to
        my needs. Here is the project structure I will start with:

        17/04/2023 (Monday) - Building a Responsive Navigation
      </h2>
      <p>
        Today, I started working on a responsive navigation for my website. For
        screens smaller than 700px wide, I designed a simple yet aesthetic
        navigation menu with five sections: Home, About, IT Blog, Projects, and
        Github. These sections are aligned to the left side of the panel. On the
        right side, I added a moon icon that serves as a toggle button. In the
        future, this button will enable users to switch the website's color
        scheme between day and night modes.
      </p>
      <p>
        For larger screens, I created an expanded version of the navigation. My
        name is displayed at the top of the navigation and will act as a link to
        the homepage in the future, so I removed the Home section from the menu.
        The moon icon remains the same but is slightly larger to accommodate the
        larger screen size.
