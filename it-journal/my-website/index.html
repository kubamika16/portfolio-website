            Folder Structure & website variables
          </h2>
          <p>
            Today I finally start creating my own personal website. That will be
            my long-term project. Website that will showcase my skills,
            experience, projects and overall commitment for programming and
            improving my life overall.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will start off by making sure that the folder structure is
            adjusted to my needs. Here is the project structure I will start
            with:

            17/04/2023 (Monday) - Building a Responsive Navigation
          </h2>
          <p>
            Today, I started working on a responsive navigation for my website.
            For screens smaller than 700px wide, I designed a simple yet
            aesthetic navigation menu with five sections: Home, About, IT Blog,
            Projects, and Github. These sections are aligned to the left side of
            the panel. On the right side, I added a moon icon that serves as a
            toggle button. In the future, this button will enable users to
            switch the website's color scheme between day and night modes.
          </p>
          <p>
            For larger screens, I created an expanded version of the navigation.
            My name is displayed at the top of the navigation and will act as a
            link to the homepage in the future, so I removed the Home section
            from the menu. The moon icon remains the same but is slightly larger
            to accommodate the larger screen size.

            18/04/2023 (Tuesday) - Developing the "About Me" Section
          </h2>
          <p>
            Today, I made a progress on my website by creating a responsive
            "About Me" section that appears right after the navigation panel.
            This section serves as an introduction to my portfolio website and
            journal. I've also included an image of a Jiu-Jitsu white belt. The
            idea is to update this image as I achieve higher belt rankings â€“ for
            instance, when I earn my blue belt next year, I'll update the image
            accordingly. Check out the demonstration of the page's
            responsiveness below.

            19/04/2023 (Wednesday) - Building the "Latest Posts" Section
          </h2>
          <p>
            Today, I developed a section dedicated to showcasing my latest
            journal entries. Each entry in the "Latest Posts" section will
            display the title and creation date of the corresponding post. For
            example, the title "Creating the 'Latest Posts' Section" would
            appear along with its date. I also added a small icon to the left of
            the date, helping to visually differentiate the types of work or
            projects I've been involved in on a specific day. In the future, I
            plan to retrieve this data from an API connected to an AWS database.
            This way, I won't have to manually update the content on a daily
            basis, streamlining the process and making it more efficient.

            20/04/2023 (Thursday) - Building the "Projects" Section
          </h2>
          <p>
            Today, my coding time was limited due to work and taking care of my
            5-year-old niece. However, I managed to create a section that
            showcases my recent projects throughout my career. Each project will
            feature its unique creation year, title, a brief description, and
            two buttons linking to the project's journal entries, detailing my
            daily progress, and a demo of the project. Below is the final
            visualization of the section, displaying two containers in a small
            resolution (optimized for smartphones).

          <p>
            Today, I successfully added responsiveness to my Projects section.
            To achieve this, I used 'display: grid' to create three columns of
            project containers in each row when the screen width reaches 700 px.
            Now, whenever a new project is added, the section automatically
            places it in a new row after there are already three projects in the
            previous row.

            Footer
          </h2>
          <p>
            Today, I completed the development of the home page by adding a
            simple footer. The footer includes my contact information such as
            LinkedIn, Gmail, phone number, and GitHub. To enhance user
            experience, I incorporated png images for a more visually engaging
            interaction with the footer.

          <p>
            I haven't posted for the last 8 days, but I've been working on my
            project every day, making daily commits to GitHub. During this time,
            I finished my home page, projects page, and about page.
          </p>
          <p>
            I just completed a layout tile that displays information about the
            ongoing development of the website. I decided to include this since
            I shared my portfolio website in my contact info on LinkedIn. This
            way, if an interviewer visits my site, they'll understand that it's
            still a work in progress, which may help explain any issues or
            "blank spaces."

          <p>
            Now, my focus is on the "Articles" page. I plan to keep this page
            simple and free of unnecessary information. It will contain all the
            lessons I'll be teaching myself throughout my career. As the page
            will feature dozens of articles, I want to keep it organized and
            tidy. It will be divided by year and include basic article details
            (title and posting date). The layout will look similar to the
            picture below:

          <h1>Creating the "IT Journal" Page (May 2, 2023)</h1>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Today, I successfully created the final page in the menu called "IT
            Journal." This page will showcase my development journey and the
            progress I've made on various projects. By clicking on each tile,
            its content will be displayed.
          </p>

            <li>
              <strong>Challenge 1:</strong>
              Adding text to the bottom of the tile, ensuring that the text
              fades away as it approaches the end of the tile.

              Learned how to create fading text. To create fading text, it's
              important to:
              <ul>
                <li>Set the position: relative on the element.</li>
                <li>Add ::after property on that element.</li>
                <li>
                  Add position absolute, set the fade to the bottom, set the
                  height (from where the fade will start), and add a background
                  image (linear gradient that starts from the bottom and goes to
                  the top).
                </li>

            Refactoring and Commenting Code for Better Structure (May 3, 2023)
          </h1>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            I've reached a point where my code is not well-structured, which
            makes scaling and adding new pages time-consuming. Any change I make
            affects the overall website structure. To improve this, I need to
            add comments to my code and refactor it for better organization.
            I'll start with the dates on my home page.
          </p>
          <h2>Tasks Completed</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Refactored dates by adding the "date-item" class for every element
              containing a date
            </li>
            <li>
              Created a separate file and placed it in the "general" folder for
              easier code reuse
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Challenge 1:</strong>
              This task wasn't too complicated, but it required identifying all
              elements with similar properties, removing redundant code, and
              creating a separate class for reusable code. This process was
              somewhat time-consuming.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Learnings</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Learning 1:</strong>
              I learned that to create a scalable website, it's crucial to add
              sufficient comments and as many reusable classes as possible. This
              not only helps with future expansion but also makes the code more
              readable.

          </h1>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            An idea about posting my journals popped into my mind. I want to
            create an easy-to-read and simple tile for my every entry in my
            journal. That tile will contain smaller ones (usually 4) that have
            titles: Introduction, Tasks Completed, Challanges Faced, Resources.
            The big article tile will have a bit title and posted date.
          </p>
          <h2>Tasks Completed</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>

              I was working on already existing structure of general
              "it-journal" page because I wanted to have very similar structure.
              Problem occured when I tried to get rid of default properties for
              title of the journal entry. I found out there is a way to do it by
              specific events for "pointer-events" and "cursor"
