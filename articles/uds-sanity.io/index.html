            <h1>Understanding Sanity.io</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="article-content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Sanity.io is a powerful, flexible, and customizable headless
              content management system (CMS) that allows developers to build
              and manage content for their websites and applications. With a
              wide range of features, Sanity.io provides developers with the
              tools they need to create, store, and deliver content seamlessly
              across different platforms. In this blog post, we'll dive into the
              basics of Sanity.io, its key features, and how to get started with
              this popular headless CMS.
            </p>

            <h2>What is a Headless CMS?</h2>
            <p>
              A headless CMS is a content management system that separates the
              content layer from the presentation layer. This means that the
              content is stored and managed independently from the way it's
              displayed on your website or application. A headless CMS provides
              content through APIs, which can be consumed by various front-end
              technologies, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Features of Sanity.io:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Real-time Collaboration: Sanity.io allows multiple users to
                collaborate on content simultaneously, making it easy for teams
                to work together on projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                Customizable Content Models: Sanity.io lets you create custom
                content models, known as "schemas," to define the structure and
                relationships between different content types.
              </li>

              <li>
                Powerful Query Language: Sanity.io uses GROQ (Graph-Relational
                Object Queries), a versatile query language that enables you to
                fetch data with ease.
              </li>

              <li>
                Portable Text: Sanity.io's portable text format allows for rich
                text editing, which can be easily converted into various formats
                like HTML, Markdown, or plain text.
              </li>

              <li>
                Asset Management: Sanity.io provides built-in support for
                managing images, videos, and other media assets.
              </li>
              <li>
                Extensibility: With Sanity.io, you can extend the functionality
                of your CMS using plugins or by writing custom code.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Getting Started with Sanity.io:</h2>
            <p>
              To begin using Sanity.io, visit their website and click 'Get
              Started'. After creating an account, you'll be provided with a
              line of code that helps you download Sanity.io in your local
              environment (for this example, we're using macOS).
            </p>
            <p>
              Run the following command in your terminal:
            </p>
            <pre>npm create sanity@latest</pre>
            <p>
              The command line will prompt you to log in using Google, GitHub,
              or email. In this case, we'll choose GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, you'll need to enter some metadata for your project. For
              this example, let's call the project 'blog'. Type 'y' (yes) for
              the default dataset configuration. Then, choose the path for your
              project. Afterward, open the project in your code editor (we'll
              use Visual Studio Code for this example).
            </p>
            <img src="imgs/1.png" alt="Project setup in VS Code" />
            <p>
              Now, navigate to your project folder in Visual Studio Code, and
              run the following command in the terminal:
            </p>
            <pre>npm run dev</pre>
            <p>
              This command starts a local development server at localhost:3333.
              Open your browser and navigate to localhost:3333 to access the
              Sanity local development environment. Here, you can easily add
              content to your blog posts.
            </p>

            <h2>Fetching that data using Javascript and AWS</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Set up AWS CLI: Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on
                your computer by following the instructions at
                https://aws.amazon.com/cli/. Configure the AWS CLI with your AWS
                credentials using aws configure.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a new folder: Create a new folder on your computer to
                store the Lambda function files.
              </li>
              <li>
                Write the Lambda function: Create a new file named index.js in
                the new folder and add the following code, replacing
                your_project_id, your_dataset, and your_api_version with the
                appropriate values:
              </li>
              <img src="imgs/3.png" alt="" />
              <li>
                Install dependencies: In the same folder as your index.js file,
                run the following command to install the Sanity client library:
              </li>
              <pre>npm init -y</pre>
              <br />
              <pre>npm install @sanity/client</pre>

              <li>
                Create a .zip file: Select all the files in the folder,
                right-click, and choose the option to create a new zip archive
                (e.g., "Compress" on macOS or "Send to > Compressed (zipped)
                folder" on Windows).
              </li>
              <li>
                Create an AWS Lambda function: In the AWS Management Console,
                navigate to the Lambda service. Click "Create function" and
                choose "Author from scratch." Enter a name for your function,
                and choose the "Node.js" runtime that corresponds to the version
                of Node.js you are using. Under "Function code," choose "Upload
                a .zip file" and select the zip file you created in step 6.
                Click "Create function."
              </li>
              <li>
                Configure Lambda function: In the "Function code" section of
                your Lambda function, set the "Handler" field to index.handler.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create an API Gateway: In the AWS Management Console, navigate
                to the API Gateway service. Click "Create API," choose "REST
                API," and click "Build." Choose "New API" and enter a name and
                description for your API. Click "Create API."
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a resource and method: In your API, click "Actions" and
                choose "Create Resource." Enter a name for the resource and
                click "Create Resource." Click "Actions" again, choose "Create
                Method," and select "GET." In the "GET" setup pane, choose
                "Lambda Function" for the "Integration type," select the "Use
                Lambda Proxy integration" checkbox, and enter the name of the
                Lambda function you created in step 7. Click "Save."
              </li>
              <li>
                Enable CORS: In your API, click "Actions" and choose "Enable
                CORS." Click "Enable CORS and replace existing CORS headers" in
                the dialog that appears. Click "Yes, replace existing values."
              </li>
              <li>
                Deploy API: In your API, click "Actions" and choose "Deploy
                API." Choose "[New Stage]" from the "Deployment stage" dropdown,
                enter a name for the new stage (e.g., "prod"), and click
                "Deploy." You will now see an "Invoke URL" at the top of the
                page.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use the API endpoint in your static site: Replace API_ENDPOINT
                with the "Invoke URL" from step 12 in the following code, and
                include it in your static site's JavaScript file:
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </div>
